# Real-time Vision-Based 4-dof Manipulator

This is the 5th year, University Integrated Design Group Project. In this development, features extractions like color thresholding and finding centres of the objects are implemented with computer vision techniques, inverse kinematics for 4 degree of freedom is computed and arduino is used as the middleware of the project.
